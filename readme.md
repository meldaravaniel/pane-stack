# PANE Stack 

## Introduction 

Herein is my experimentation with PostgreSQL, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js as an end-to-end javascript framework.  I know pg and angular, but am learning about full-stack javascript development, so this is my playground! Yay! 

Started with this very useful tutorial by Tania Rascia: https://blog.logrocket.com/setting-up-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-postgresql-d96d6fc892d8  If you find that useful, buy her a ko-fi: ko-fi.com/taniarascia
